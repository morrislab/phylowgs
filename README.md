PhyloWGS
========

This Python/C++ code is the accompanying software for the paper [PhyloWGS:
Reconstructing subclonal composition and evolution from whole-genome sequencing
of tumors](http://genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/35), with authors Amit G.
Deshwar, Shankar Vembu, Christina K. Yung, Gun Ho Jang, Lincoln Stein, and Quaid
Morris.


Input files
-----------
The input to evolve.py is two tab-delimited text files -- one for SSM data and
one for CNV data. Please see the files `ssm_data.txt` and `cnv_data.txt`
included with PhyloWGS for examples.

To see how to generate `ssm_data.txt` and `cnv_data.txt` from a VCF file and
[Battenberg](https://github.com/cancerit/cgpBattenberg) CNV file, please see
[the included parser](parser/).

`ssm_data.txt`:

* `id`: identifier for each SSM. Identifiers must start at `s0` and
  increment, so the first data row will have `s0`, the second row `s1`, and so
  forth.
* `gene`: any string identifying the variant -- this need not be a gene name.
  `<chr>_<pos>` (e.g., `2_234577`) works well.
* `a`: number of reference-allele reads at the variant locus.
* `d`: total number of reads at the variant locus.
* `mu_r`: fraction of expected reference allele sampling from the *reference*
  population. E.g., if the tumor has an A->T somatic mutation at the locus,
  the genotype of the reference population should be AA. Thus, `mu_r` should
  be `1 - (sequencing error rate)`. Given the 0.001 error rate in Illumina
  sequencing, setting this column to 0.999 works well.
* `mu_v`: fraction of expected reference allele sampling from *variant*
  population. Suppose an A->T somatic mutation occurred at the locus. `mu_v`
  always uses normal ploidy (i.e., the copy number in non-CNV regions). As
  humans are diploid, copy number will thus always be 2. So, the variant
  population genotype should be AT, meaning we will observe the reference
  allele with frequency `0.5 - (sequencing error rate)`. Given the 0.001
  error rate in Illumina sequencing, setting this column to 0.499 works well.

`cnv_data.txt`: Note that if you are running without any CNVs, this file should
be empty. You can create the empty file via the command `touch cnv_data.txt`.

* `cnv`: identifier for each CNV. Identifiers must start at `c0` and
  increment, so the first data row will have `c0`, the second row `c1`, and so
  forth.
* `a`: number of reference reads covering the CNV.
* `d`: total number of reads covering the CNV. This will be affected by
  factors such as total copy number at the locus, sequencing depth, and the
  size of the chromosomal region spanned by the CNV.
* `ssms`: SSMs that overlap with this CNV. Each entry is a comma-separated
  triplet consisting of SSM ID, maternal copy number, and paternal copy
  number. These triplets are separated by semicolons.

When running `evolve.py`, the random seed used for the run will be written to
`random_seed.txt` in the current directory. To choose this seed, you may give
the `--random-seed <integer>` option to `evolve.py`. If no random seed is
specified, but the `random_seed.txt` file already exists in the current working
directory, the seed stored in that file will be used. This behaviour lets you
deterministically repeat runs by copying the `random_seed.txt` files from a
previous batch.

        # Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your web browser. Note that, by
        # default, the server listens for connections from any host.


Resuming a previous PhyloWGS run
--------------------------------

If PhyloWGS is interrupted for whatever reason, you can resume your existing
run by simply running `evolve.py` from the same directory as the previous run,
without any command-line params:

    # Start initial run.
    python2 evolve.py ssm_data.txt cnv_data.txt

    # Hit CTRL+C to send SIGINT, halting run partway through.

    # Resume run:
    python2 evolve.py
